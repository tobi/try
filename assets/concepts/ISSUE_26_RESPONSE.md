# Response to GitHub Issue #26: Logo Design Proposals

## Summary

Thank you for the thoughtful logo design proposals! Your concepts beautifully capture the essence of `try` - organized chaos, developer-centric design, and the spirit of experimentation.

## What We've Done

To properly acknowledge and organize these design contributions, we've created:

### 1. **Documentation Structure**
- ✅ [LOGO_CONCEPTS.md](../../LOGO_CONCEPTS.md) - Detailed documentation of all three proposed concepts
- ✅ [assets/README.md](../README.md) - Logo usage guidelines and integration instructions
- ✅ Updated main README.md with Design Contributions section

### 2. **Assets Directory Structure**
```
assets/
├── README.md              # Usage guidelines
├── logos/                 # Final approved logos
│   ├── svg/              # Vector formats
│   ├── png/              # Raster formats (various sizes)
│   └── ico/              # Icon formats
└── concepts/             # Design concepts
    └── proposals/        # Community submissions
```

### 3. **Concept Documentation**

All three concepts have been documented with:
- Visual descriptions
- Design rationale
- Use cases
- Implementation guidelines
- Color and typography recommendations

## The Concepts

### Concept 1: "Minimal File Path" (`t/r/y >`)
- ✅ Developer-centric typography
- ✅ Terminal-inspired aesthetic
- ✅ Clean and minimal
- ✅ Easy to reproduce in ASCII

### Concept 2: "Scribble" (Chaos → Clarity)
- ✅ Powerful visual metaphor
- ✅ Shows transformation from chaos to organization
- ✅ Unique and memorable
- ✅ Flexible for various contexts

### Concept 3: "Scribble in Typography"
- ✅ Combines best of both concepts
- ✅ Readable yet meaningful
- ✅ Works as both icon and wordmark
- ✅ Distinctive visual identity

## Next Steps

### For the Community
1. **Provide Feedback** - Comment on Issue #26 with your preferences
2. **Vote** - Which concept resonates most with you?
3. **Refine** - Suggestions for improvements?

### For the Designer
If you'd like to develop any of these concepts further:

1. **Choose a concept** based on community feedback
2. **Create final assets:**
   - SVG (primary format)
   - PNG (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512)
   - Both dark and light mode versions
   - Monochrome version
3. **Submit via PR** to `assets/concepts/proposals/[your-name]/`
4. **Include:**
   - Design files
   - Brief description
   - Usage examples

### For Maintainers
1. Gather community feedback on Issue #26
2. Select preferred concept(s)
3. Work with designer on refinement
4. Integrate final logo into:
   - README.md header
   - Documentation
   - Package manager listings (Homebrew, Nix)
   - Social media

## Design Requirements

All submissions should:
- ✅ Work in both dark and light modes
- ✅ Be legible at 32x32px minimum
- ✅ Reflect developer-centric, minimal aesthetic
- ✅ Be provided in vector format (SVG)
- ✅ Include monochrome version
- ✅ Be original work or properly licensed

## Integration Examples

### README Header
```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/logos/svg/try-logo-primary-dark.svg" alt="try logo" width="200">
</p>
```

### Terminal ASCII Art

## Thank You!

Your contribution helps make `try` more visually distinctive and memorable. The thoughtfulness in your concepts - especially the metaphor of organized chaos - perfectly captures what this tool is about.

This kind of community contribution is what makes open source special. Thank you for taking the time to create these concepts! 🎨
