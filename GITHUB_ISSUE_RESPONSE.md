## Comment to Post on Issue #26

Thank you so much for these thoughtful logo design proposals! 🎨 Your concepts beautifully capture the essence of `try` - the balance between organized chaos, developer-centric design, and the spirit of experimentation.

### What We've Done

To properly acknowledge and organize your contribution, we've created a complete branding infrastructure:

1. **📐 [LOGO_CONCEPTS.md](../LOGO_CONCEPTS.md)** - Comprehensive documentation of all three concepts with design rationale, use cases, and implementation guidelines

2. **🎨 [assets/README.md](../assets/README.md)** - Logo usage guidelines, file format specifications, and integration examples

3. **📁 Assets Directory Structure** - Organized folders for logos (SVG, PNG, ICO) and design concepts

4. **✨ Updated README** - Added Design Contributions section linking to the new documentation

### The Three Concepts

All three of your concepts have been documented in detail:

1. **Minimal File Path** (`t/r/y >`) - Clean, developer-centric typography that speaks directly to terminal users
2. **Scribble** (Chaos → Clarity) - Powerful visual metaphor showing transformation from scattered experiments to organized clarity
3. **Scribble in Typography** - Combines the best of both, integrating the metaphor within the wordmark

### Next Steps

**For the community:**
- Which concept resonates most with you?
- Any suggestions for refinement?
- Other ideas inspired by these concepts?

**For you (the designer):**
If you'd like to develop any of these concepts further based on community feedback, we've created guidelines in [assets/README.md](../assets/README.md) for:
- File formats and sizes needed
- Color mode requirements (dark/light/mono)
- Submission process via PR

### Why This Matters

Your contribution goes beyond just visual design - it helps establish `try`'s identity in the developer tools ecosystem. The metaphor of "organized chaos" in Concept 2 particularly resonates with the project's philosophy:

> *"Built for developers with ADHD by developers with ADHD."*

### Thank You

> *"After the high from doing the same thing for Omarchy, I'm inspired to do the same for more open source projects."*

This kind of community contribution is what makes open source special. Thank you for taking the time to create these concepts and for helping make `try` more visually distinctive! 

We're excited to see where the community takes this. Feel free to refine any of the concepts based on feedback, and we'll work together to integrate the final design.

Thank you for these excellent logo concepts! 🎨

We've created a complete branding infrastructure to properly acknowledge your contribution:

- 🎨 [assets/README.md](../assets/README.md) - Usage guidelines and integration instructions
- 📁 Assets directory structure for future logo files

All three concepts are compelling:
1. **Minimal File Path** - Clean, terminal-inspired typography
2. **Scribble** - Powerful chaos→clarity metaphor
3. **Scribble in Typography** - Best of both worlds

**Community:** Which concept do you prefer? Any refinement suggestions?

**Designer:** If you'd like to develop the chosen concept further, check out the contribution guidelines in [assets/README.md](../assets/README.md).

Thank you for helping establish `try`'s visual identity! The "organized chaos" metaphor perfectly captures what this tool is about. 🏠
