# try - fresh directories for every vibe

*Your experiments deserve a home.* üè†

> For everyone who constantly creates new projects for little experiments, a one-file Ruby script to quickly manage and navigate to keep them somewhat organized

Ever find yourself with 50 directories named `test`, `test2`, `new-test`, `actually-working-test`, scattered across your filesystem? Or worse, just coding in `/tmp` and losing everything?

**try** is here for your beautifully chaotic mind.

# What it does 

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/ve8AXBaPhkKz40YbqPTlVjqgs.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/ve8AXBaPhkKz40YbqPTlVjqgs)

Instantly navigate through all your experiment directories with:
- **Fuzzy search** that just works
- **Smart sorting** - recently used stuff bubbles to the top
- **Auto-dating** - creates directories like `2025-08-17-redis-experiment`
- **Zero config** - just one Ruby file, no dependencies

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobi/try/refs/heads/main/try.rb > ~/.local/try.rb

# Make "try" executable so it can be run directly
chmod +x ~/.local/try.rb

# Add to your shell (bash/zsh)
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/try.rb init ~/src/tries)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## The Problem

You're learning Redis. You create `/tmp/redis-test`. Then `~/Desktop/redis-actually`. Then `~/projects/testing-redis-again`. Three weeks later you can't find that brilliant connection pooling solution you wrote at 2am.

## The Solution

All your experiments in one place, with instant fuzzy search:

```bash
$ try pool
‚Üí 2025-08-14-redis-connection-pool    2h, 18.5
  2025-08-03-thread-pool              3d, 12.1
  2025-07-22-db-pooling               2w, 8.3
  + Create new: pool
```

Type, arrow down, enter. You're there.

## Features

### üéØ Smart Fuzzy Search
Not just substring matching - it's smart:
- `rds` matches `redis-server`
- `connpool` matches `connection-pool`
- Recent stuff scores higher
- Shorter names win on equal matches

### ‚è∞ Time-Aware
- Shows how long ago you touched each project
- Recently accessed directories float to the top
- Perfect for "what was I working on yesterday?"

### üé® Pretty TUI
- Clean, minimal interface
- Highlights matches as you type
- Shows scores so you know why things are ranked
- Dark mode by default (because obviously)

### üìÅ Organized Chaos
- Everything lives in `~/src/tries` (configurable via `TRY_PATH`)
- Auto-prefixes with dates: `2025-08-17-your-idea`
- Skip the date prompt if you already typed a name

### Shell Integration

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:



```bash
# default is ~/src/tries
eval "$(~/.local/try.rb init)"
```

Or if you want to customize the location:

```bash
eval "$(~/.local/try.rb init ~/src/tries)"
```

## Usage

```bash
try                                 # Browse all experiments
try redis                           # Jump to redis experiment or create new
try https://github.com/tobi/try.git # Create experiment directory 2025-08-17-try, clone git then jump into it    
try new api                         # Start with "2025-08-17-new-api"
try --help                          # See all options
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `‚Üë/‚Üì` or `Ctrl-P/N` - Navigate
- `Enter` - Select or create
- `Backspace` - Delete character
- `ESC` - Cancel
- Just type to filter

## Configuration

Set `TRY_PATH` to change where experiments are stored:

```bash
export TRY_PATH=~/code/sketches
```

Default: `~/src/tries`

## Nix

### Quick start

```bash
nix run github:tobi/try
nix run github:tobi/try -- --help
nix run github:tobi/try init ~/my-tries
```

### Home Manager

```nix
{
  inputs.try.url = "github:tobi/try";
  
  imports = [ inputs.try.homeManagerModules.default ];
  
  programs.try = {
    enable = true;
    path = "~/experiments";  # optional, defaults to ~/src/tries
  };
}
```

## Why Ruby?

- One file, no dependencies
- Works on any system with Ruby (macOS has it built-in)
- Fast enough for thousands of directories
- Easy to hack on

## The Philosophy

Your brain doesn't work in neat folders. You have ideas, you try things, you context-switch like a caffeinated squirrel. This tool embraces that.

Every experiment gets a home. Every home is instantly findable. Your 2am coding sessions are no longer lost to the void.

## FAQ

**Q: Why not just use `cd` and `ls`?**
A: Because you have 200 directories and can't remember if you called it `test-redis`, `redis-test`, or `new-redis-thing`.

**Q: Why not use `fzf`?**
A: fzf is great for files. This is specifically for project directories, with time-awareness and auto-creation built in.

**Q: Can I use this for real projects?**
A: You can, but it's designed for experiments. Real projects deserve real names in real locations.

**Q: What if I have thousands of experiments?**
A: First, welcome to the club. Second, it handles it fine - the scoring algorithm ensures relevant stuff stays on top.
