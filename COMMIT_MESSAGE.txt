docs: add logo design infrastructure for Issue #26

Implement comprehensive branding infrastructure to acknowledge and
organize community-contributed logo design proposals.

Changes:
- Create assets/ directory structure for logos and design concepts
- Add LOGO_CONCEPTS.md documenting three proposed logo designs:
  1. Minimal File Path (t/r/y >) - terminal-inspired typography
  2. Scribble - visual metaphor of chaos becoming clarity
  3. Scribble in Typography - combination of both concepts
- Add assets/README.md with logo usage guidelines and integration docs
- Add assets/concepts/ISSUE_26_RESPONSE.md with detailed response
- Update README.md with Design Contributions section
- Create subdirectories for logo formats (svg/, png/, ico/)
- Add .gitkeep files to maintain empty directory structure

The infrastructure provides:
- Clear guidelines for design contributions
- File format specifications and naming conventions
- Integration examples for README, docs, and package managers
- Framework for community feedback and refinement process

This establishes a professional foundation for the project's visual
identity while maintaining the minimal, developer-centric philosophy.

Closes #26
